## SEO Notes

* HTML Text  - put all important words / phrases here
* Alt text - add to all images
* Link tree - have links from root all the way to searchable pages
* Testing tools - Google's cache, SEO-browser.com, MozBar
* Search forms - not used by crawlers
* `rel="nofollow"` - not followed by crawlers
* Use keywords:   
  - in the title tag  
  - at least two or three times in text  
  - in alt attribute of an image   
  - in the URL    
  - in the meta description tag   
  - NOT in link anchor text pointing to other pages on your site   

* Title tags: 
  - keep to 65-75 characters  
  - put keywords close to front
  - end with branding
  - user-grabbing text

* Never repeat content
* OR use canonical tag: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://moz.com/blog"/>`
* Rich snippets help highlight info
* Absolute links > relative, ex. `<a href="https://moz.com">Home</a>` > `<a href="../">Home</a>`
